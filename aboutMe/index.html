    <p> I love to play video games and nerd out on my school work as well as coding. But what I love to do most of all is spend time with my wife whenever possible.
        We have been married since May 15th of 2022 and in August had our first little baby girl who is now 4 months old.
        I am currently unemployeed, unfortunately, as finding suitable work is difficult right now while trying to persue an education as well as being a newly founded father.
        So, I have decided to persue education as much as possible to give me greater hopes of finding suitable work for the future while at home taking care of my daughter. 
    </p>
    <p> I love BYU-Idaho as it has given me the chance to learn in ways that I have always wanted to, from it being cost affective, to it allowing me to pace myself.
        I plan on persuing an Applied Technology Bachelor of Science degree which I am looking at a lot of fun years of work to come with it.
        What I plan to get from this class, however, is the fundimentals of using HTML to create WebSites in the future or to even be able to edit existing Websites as a possible job.
        I plan to do so with the help of javascript as well.

    <p> I have been an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for nearly 3 years now. I got baptisted for my 3rd time with my still current ward.
        I also, of course, want that to be my final baptism, but I enjoyed accepting the Holy Ghost into my body life. Also, my favorite scripture from the bible is Proverbs 29:11.
        In this verse it says as I quote "A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till affterwards." This quote, to me, speaks of a person and their rage or anger.
        As I grew, I had a diffiult time understanding how to control my anger being I had a sadly short fuse. Now however, after actually spending time talking about this with God
        feel it much easier to conduct myself without using anger at all at in most situations. Everyone still has a limit however but my fuse feels as though it's grown a million 
        times in length. God gave me the most challenging and testing thing he had to offer to help me grow, a daughter. A child to me is the most challenging but really the most 
        rewarding, thye teach you how to be a stronger person and what it means to protect.

    <p> Thank you for listening! I hope we all do well this semester.</p>
