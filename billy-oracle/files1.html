    <h2>Finding The Max Or Min</h2>
    <p>A way yo find the largest number in a list is to keep track of the largest number found to date, and then update that value if you find a new one that is larger. Example as follows:</p>
    <img class="max" src="images/max.png" alt="max example">
    <p>Produces the following result:</p>
    <img class="max-output" src="images/max-output.png" alt="max output of the example above">
    <p>It is important to remember to start the "largest_so_far" variable at either the first value (assuming it's not an empty list) or else something that you know will be smaller than everything in your list. Otherwise, you won't consider some numbers. For example, if you
         started it at 10, then you would never consider anything less than 10.
    </p>
    <h2>Keeping Track Of The Item That Is The MAx Or Min</h2>
    <p>What if you want to know not only which number is the largest, but also the item that is the largest? For example, you may want to know not only the most expensive price in your shopping cart, but the actual product that is the most expensive. The logic above will only
        find the largest value. To find the largest item, you'll also need to keep track of its name or value along the way.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the following list of products in a shopping cart, along with their prices:
    </p>
    <img class="shopping-cart" src="images/shopping-cart.png" alt="shopping cart example">
    <p>In order to find the most expensive price, we can iterate through it as before:</p>
    <img class="price" src="images/price.png" alt="iterating through a shopping list">
    <p> This produces the following output:</p>
    <img class="price-output" src="images/price-output.png" alt="iterating through shopping list output">
    <p>If we want to find the name of the item that is the most expensive, we need to declare a variable (for example, max_product) before the loop to keep track of the product that had the maximum price. Then, whenever we update the max_price to save a new price, we also 
        update the max_product to be the corresponding product name. Example:</p>
    <img class="max-product" src="images/max-product.png" alt="max product example">
    <p>This is the output:</p> 
    <img class="max-product-output" src="images/max-product-output.png" alt=" output of the max product example above">
    <h2>Other Code With Loops And Files</h2>
    <p>In addition to the code samples you've seen here, keep in mind that you can use all of the other components you have learned throughout the semester in conjunction with files. For example, if you wanted to restrict your analysis of products to only those that had a price
         over certain amount, or that had a name matching certain criteria, you can include an if statement in the middle of the loop that is iterating through the file.
