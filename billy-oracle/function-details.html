    <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope of a variable determines how long that variable exists and where it can be used. Within a Python program, there are two categories of scope: local and global. A variable has local scope when it is defined (assigned a value) inside a function. 
        A variable a global scope when it is defined outside of all functions. Here is a small Python program that has two variables: g and x. g is defined outside of all functions and therefore has global scope. x is defined inside the main function and therefore 
        has local scope.
    </p>
    <img class="local-global" src="images/local-global.png" alt="global and local variable examples">
    <p>As shown in the following table, a local variable (a variable with local scope) is defined inside a function, exists for as long as its containing function is executing, and can be used within its containing function but nowhere else. A global variable 
        (a variable with global scope) is defined outside all functions, exists for as long as its containing Python program is executing, and can be user within all functions in its containing Python program.
    </p>
    <img class="global-def" src="images/global-def.png" alt="local global definitions">
    <p>The following Python code example contains parameters and variables. Parameters have local scope because they are defined within a function, specifically within a function's header and exist for as long as their containing function is executing. The variable 
        "nShapes" is global because it is defined outside of all functions. Because it is a global variable, the code in the body of all functions may use the variable "nShapes". Within the "square_area" function, the parameter named length and the variable named area 
        both have local scope. Within the "rectangle_area" function, the parameters named width and length and the variable named "area" have local scope.
    </p>
    <img class="square-area" src="images/square-area.png" alt="square area example">
    <p>Because local variables are visible only within the function where they are defined, a programmer can define two variables with the same name as long as he defines them in different functions. In the previous example, both of the square_area and rectangle_area functions 
        contain a parameter named length and a variable named area. All four of these variables are entirely separate and do not conflict with each other in any way because the scope of each variable is local to the function where it is defined.
    </p>
    <h2>Common Mistake</h2>
    <p>A common mistake that many programmers make is to assume that local variable can be used inside other functions. For example, the Python program in example 3 includes two functions named main and circle_area. Line 6 in main defines a variable named radius. Some programmers assume 
        that the variable radius that is defined in main (ad is therefore local to main only) can be used in the circle_area function. However. local variables from one function cannot be used inside another function. The local variables from main cannot be used inside circle_area.
    </p>
    <img class="def-main" src="images/def-main.png" alt="def main example">
    <p>The correct way to fix the mistake in example 3 is to add a parameter to the circle_area function as shown at line 10 and pass the radius from the main function to the circle_area function as shown at line 7 in example 4.</p>

    <h2>Default Parameter Values and Optional Arguments</h2>
    <p>Python allows function parameters to have default values. If a parameter has a default value, then its corresponding argument is optional. If a function is called without an argument, the corresponding parameter gets its default value.</p>
    <p>Consider the program in example 5. Notice at line 19 in the header for the arc_length function, that the parameter radius does not have a default value but the parameter degrees has a default value of 360. This means that when a programmer writes code to call the arc_length function, 
        the programmer must pass a value for radius but is not required to pass a value for degrees. At line 8, the programmer wrote code to call the arc_length function and passed 4.7 for the radius parameter but did not pass a value for the degrees, so during that call to arc_length, the 
        value of degrees will be the default value from line 19, which is 360. At line 13, the programmer wrote code to call the arc_length function again and passed two arguments: 4.7 and 270, so during that call to arc_length, the value of degrees will be 270.

    <h2>Function Design</h2>
    <p>What are the properties of a good function?</p>
    <p>There are many things to consider when writing a function, and many authors have written about design concepts that make functions easier to understand and less error prone. The following list contains a few properties that you should incorporate into your functions.</p>
    <li>
        <ul>A good function is understandable by other programmers. One way to make a function understandable is to write a documentation string at the top of the function that describes the function, it's parameters, and its return value. Another way to make a function understandable is to 
            write comments in the body of the function as needed.</ul>
        <ul>A good function performs a single task that the programmer can describe and the function's name matches its task.</ul>
        <ul>A good function is relatively short, perhaps fewer than 20 lines of code.</ul>
        <ul>A good function has a few decision points (if statements and loops) as possible. Too many decision points in a function make a function error prone and difficult to test.</ul>
        <ul>A good function is as reusable as possible. Functions that use parameters and return a result are more reusable than functions that get input from a user and print results to a terminal window.</ul>
