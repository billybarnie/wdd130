    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>A Python program can store many values in a list. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created. Each value in a list is called an element and is stored at a unique index. An index is always an integer and determines where an 
        element is stored in a list. The first index of a Python list is always zero (0). The following diagram shows a list that contains five strings. The diagram shows both the elements and the indexes of the list. Notice that each index is a unique integer, 
        and that the first index is zero.
    </p>
    <img class="list-length" src="images/list-length.png" alt="list length example image">
    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square brackets ([ and ]). We can determine the number of items in a list by calling the built-in len function. We can retrieve an item from a list and replace an item in a list using square brackets 
        ([ and ]) and an index. Example 1 contains a program that creates a list, prints the length of the list, retrieves and prints one item from the list, changes one item in the list, and then prints the entire list.
    </p>
    <img class="retrieve-length" src="images/retrieve-length.png" alt="example one image">
    <p>We can add an item to a list by using the insert and append methods. We can determine if an element is in a list by using the Python membership operator, which is the keyword in. We can find the index of an item within a list by using the index method. 
        We can remove an item from a list by using the pop and remove methods. Example 2 shows how to create a list and add, find, and remove items from a list.</p>

    <p>The lists in examples 1 and 2 store strings. Of course, it is possible to store numbers in a list, too. Python allows a program to store any data type in a list, including other lists.</p>
    <h2>Repetition</h2>
    <p>A programmer can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements by writing for and while loops.</p>
    <h2>for loop</h2>
    <p>A for loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list. This means a for loop causes the computer to repeatedly execute the statements in the body of the for loop, once for each element in the sequence. In example 3, consider the list of colors at line 5 and 
        the for loop at lines 8-9. Notice how the for loop causes the computer to repeat line 9 once for each element in the colors list. Of course, the code in the body of a loop can do much more with each element than simply print it.
    </p>
    <img class="exam-3" src="images/exam-3.png" alt="example 3 image">
    <p>Notice in example 3 at lines 8-9 that just like if statements in Python, the body of a loop starts and ends with indentation.</p>
    <h2>Range Function</h2>
    <p>The Python built-in range function creates and returns a sequence of numbers. The range function accepts one, two, or three parameters as shown in example 4 and it's output. Many programmers use the range function in a for loop to cause the computer to repeat 
        code once for each number in a range of numbers. Example 4 shows four for loops that iterate over a range of numbers.
    </p>
    <img class="--name--" src="images/--name--.png" alt="example 4 image">
    <img class="--name--output" src="images/--name--output.png" alt="example 4 output image">
    <p>In example 5 at lines 8-9 and lines 15-17, there are two for loops. Both loops print each element from a list named colors. The first loop iterates over the elements in the colors list. The second loop uses the built-in len and range functions to iterate over 
        the indexes of the colors list. Which style of for loop do you prefer to read and write? Most programmers prefer to write a loop like the ones at lines 8-9 because it is simpler than the ones at lines 15-17.
    </p>
    <img class="colors-list" src="images/colors-list.png" alt="colors list example">
    <p>In the previous example, the code in the body of both for loops is very short and simply prints one lement from the list each time through the loop. However, you can write as many lines of code as you need in the body of a loop to repeatedly perform all sorts 
        of computations for each elements in a list.
    </p>
    <h2>Break Statement</h2>
    <p>A break statement causes a loop to end early. In example 6 at lines 8-12, there is a for loop that asks the user to input ten numbers one at a time. However, the loop will terminate early if the user enters a zero (0) because of the if statement and break 
        statement and break statement at lines 10 and 11.</p>
    <img class="range10" src="images/range10.png" alt="example 6 image">
    <h2>While Loop</h2>
    <p>A while loop is more flexible than a for loop and repeats while some condition is true. Imagine that need a function to compare the contents of two lists? Can we use a loop to compare the contents of two lists? Example 7 contains a while loop at lines 35-46 with 
        an if statement at line 42 that finds the first index where two lists differ.
    </p>
    <img class="len-list" src="images/len-list.png" alt="example 7 image">
    <img class="len-list-out" src="images/len-list-out.png" alt="example 7 output image">
    <h2>Compound Lists</h2>
    <p>A compound list is a list that contains other lists. Compound lists are used to store lots of related data, Example 8 shows how to create a compound list, retrieve one inner list from the compound list, and retrieve an individual number from the inner list.</p>
    <img class="exam-8" src="images/example-8.png" alt="example 8 image">
    <p>Example 9 shows how to process all elements in a compound list. The for loop at line 24 causes the computer to repeat lines 24-34 once of each inner list that is inside the compound list named apple_tree_data. Line 28 retrieves the fruit amount from one inner list 
        and then line 34 add one fruit amount to the total fruit amount.
    </p>
    <img class="example-9" src="images/example-9.png" alt="example 9 image">
    <h2>Values and References</h2>
    <p>In a Python program, the computer assigns values to ariables differently based on their data type. Consider the small program in example 10 and the output of that program. The program in example 10 contains two integer variables named x and y. The program 
        in example does the following:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>The statement at line 4 stores the value 17 into the variable x.</ul>
        <ul>Line 5 copies the value that is in the variable x into the variable y.</ul>
        <ul>Line 6 prints the values of x and y which are both 17.</ul>
        <ul>Line 7 adds one to the value of x, making its value 18 instead of 17.</ul>
        <ul>Line 8 prints the values of x and y again. The value of x was changed to 18. The value of y remained unchanged.</ul>
    </li>
    <p>Why does line 7 (x += 1) change the value of x but not change the value of y? Because line 5 copies the value that was in x into y. In other words, x and y are two separate variables, each with its own value.</p>
    <img class="example-10" src="images/example-10.png" alt="example 10 image">
    <p>Example 11 shows a small Python program that contains two variables named lx and ly that each refer to a list. This program is similar to the previous program, but it has two lists instead of two integers. From the output of example 11, we see there is a big 
        difference between the way a Python program assigns integers and the way it assigns lists. The program in example 11 does the following:
    </p>
    <li>
        <ul>The statement at line 4 creates a list and stores a reference to that list in the variable lx.</ul>
        <ul>Line 5 copies the refernce in the variable lx into the variable ly. Line 5 does not create a cope of the list but instead causes both the variables lx and ly to refer to the same list.</ul>
        <ul>Line 6 prints the values of lx and ly. Notice that their values are the same as we expect them to be because of line 5.</ul>
        <ul>Line 7 appends the number 5 onto the list lx.</ul>
        <ul>Line 8 prints the values of lx and ly again. Notice in the output that when lx and ly are printed the second time, it appears that the number 5 was appended to both lists.</ul>
    </li>
    <p>Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto lx also appends the number 5 onto ly? Because lx and ly refer to the same list. There is really only one list with teo references to that list. Because lx and ly refer to the same list, a change to the lost through 
        variable lx can be seen through variable ly.
    </p>
    <img class="exam-11" src="images/exam-11.png" alt="example 11 image">
    <p>From examples 10 and 11, we learn that when a computer executes a Python statement to assign the value of a boolean, integer, or float variable to another variable (y = x), the computer copies the value of one variable into the other. However, when a computer 
        executes a Python statement to assign the value of a list variavel to another variable (ly = lx), the computer does not copy the value but instead copies the reference so that both variables refer to the same list in memory.
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale for pass by Reference</h2>
    <p>Why are booleans and numbers passed to a function by value and lists are passed to a function by reference? To understand the answer to this question, consider the work a computer would have to do if lists were passed by value.</p>
    <p>When a computer passes a number (or boolean) variable to a function, the number is passed by value which means the computer copies the value of the number variable into the parameter of the ccalled function. This works well for numbers because each number variable 
        occupies a small amount of the computer's memory. Making a copy of a number is fast, and the copy uses a small amount of memory.
    </p>
    <p>However, a list may contain millions of elements and therefore occupy a large amount of the computer's memory. If lists were passed by value to a function, the computer would have to make a copy of a list each time it is passed to a function. If a list is large, 
        copying the list takes a relatively long time and uses a lot of the computer's memory for the copy. Therefore, to make programs fast and use less memory, lists (and other large data types) are passed to a function by reference.</p>
    <h2>Pass by Value and Pass by Reference</h2>
    <p>The fact that the computer copies the value of some data types (boolean, integer, float) and copies the reference for other data types (list and other large data types) has important implications for passing arguments into functions. Consider the Python program in 
        example 12 with two functions named main and modify_args. The program in example 12 does the following:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>The statement at line 5 assigns the value 5 to a variable named x.</ul>
        <ul>Line 6 assigns a list to a variable named lx.</ul>
        <ul>Line 7 prints the values of x and lx before they are passed to the modify_args function.</ul>
        <ul>Line 11 calls the modify_args function and passes x and lx to that function.</ul>
        <ul>Within the modify_args function, line 28 changes the value of the parameter n by adding one to it, and line 29 changes the value of the parameter alist by appending the number 4 onto it.</ul>
        <ul>Line 13 prints the values of x and lx after they were passed to the modify_args function. Notice in the output below that the value of x was not changed by the modify_args function. However, the value of lx was changed by the modify_args function.</ul>
    </li>
    <img class="modify-args" src="images/modify-args.png" alt="example 12 image">
    <img class="arg-out" src="images/arg-out.png" alt="example 12 output image">
    <p>From the output of example 12, we see that modifying an integer parameter changes the integer within the called function only. However, modifying a list parameter changes the list within ht ecalled function and within the calling function. Why? Because when a computer 
        passed a boolean, integer, or float variable to a function, the computer copies the value of an argument into a parameter is known as pass by value. However, when a computer passes a list variable to a function, the computer copies the reference so that the original 
        variable and the parameter both refer to the same list in memory. Copying the reference of an argument into a parameter os known as pass by reference.
