    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>You have already seen a type of data known as strings, which can be sequences of any kind of characters
        (letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, etc.), such like "The book of: 1 Nephi" and "yellow puppy".
    </p>
    <p>A sequence of number, such as "48212", can be converted to a numeric data type and stored internally as a number;
        otherwise, the computer doesn't distinguish numbers from a sequence of letters. Once you have converted the String
        to a number, you can use it in mathematical formulas of expressions.

    <p>See the videos below for more information:</p>

    <h2>Using Different Data Types</h2>
    <p>As seen in the videos, when data is stored in a variable, the computer treats it as a certain data type (such as a string
        or an integer). You have to be conscious of these different data types when you want to mix them together, such as when 
        you want to display a number alongside the text of a string.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to display number alongside text, is to use a format string like so:</p>
    <img class="format-string" src="images/format.png" alt="format">
    <p>This sample works well, and is the preferred way to display a number in your print statement alongside text. But in order
        to properly use different data types, you'll need a little deeper understanding of them as well as how operators like plus
        sign work with them.
    </p>
    <h2>Operators And Different Data Types</h2>
    <p>Consider the plus operator "+". When you add two strings, it glues them together, one right after the other (the technical 
        term for this is that it concatenates them):</p>
    <img class="concatenate" src="images/concatenate.png" alt="image of concatenate">
    <p>On the other hand, if the data type of the variables is integer or floating point, the plus (+) operator actually performs
        the mathematical addition:
    </p>

    <h2>Mixing Strings And Numbers</h2>
    <p>A potential problem arises if you try to mix strings and numeric data types together. For example, trying to add a string 
        to an integer produces the following error:
    </p>
    <img class="error" src="images/error1.png" alt="Example of an error">
    <p>The computer doesn't know how to add strings to numbers, which causes an error. In this case, what you want is for the computer
        to treat the number stored in the "apple_count" variable as a string instead of a number. It might seem obvious to you that 
        this is the desired behavior, but the computer doesn't try to guess what you want, you must explicitly tell it when you want it
        to convert one type of data to another.
    </p>
    <p>Converting data from one type to another is called type-casting, or "casting". That's just a fancy way of saying "treat it like
         a number please". To convert data to an integer, you put "int" before it, and then wrap it in parentheses, like this: 
         "int(data_type)". The same is true for converting it to a floating number with the term "float()" or string with "str()" and 
         so on.
    </p>
    <p>Example below shows this:</p>
    <img class="intger" src="images/intexample.png" alt="integer made">
    <p>Whenever you get input from the user using "input", it will be a string by default:</p>
    <img class="input" src="images/input.png" alt="syntax of input wrap">
    <p>Similar to the last example, you can combine the "input" and "int" commands into one line:</p>
    <img class="combine" src="images/combine.png" alt="combines input with int command">
    <h2>Expressions And Mathematical Operations</h2>
    <p>Once you have numeric values stored in variables, you can perform a variety of complex mathematical operations. The following are 
        common mathematical operators in Python:
    </p>
    <img class="operations" src="images/operators.png" alt="list of operators">
    <p>These operators follow standard mathematical orders of operation (where "*" happens before "+"), but you can force it to evaluate 
        using parentheses. For example, "(3 + 4) * 2" will perform the addition first, and then multiply the result by 2.
