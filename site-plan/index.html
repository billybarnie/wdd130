                <h2>More Information on Our Purpose</h2>
                <p> The idea behind making this site is to get people to quit smoking and while in theory it might sound easy for people, not always is that the case. We focus on these individuals by giving them a combination of allowing them to talk about their days in a therapeutic manner as well as giving themselves a sense of introspection as well as opening themselves up to only constructive criticism that is meant to build eachother up in emotional and physical manners. This will then allow us and even themselves to understand why it was that they started smoking cigarettes in the first place, and from there see if talking out that issue and giving possible solutions will help benefit them in the long run and if it will help them find a better way to stay away from said cigarettes.</p>
