      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The idea of Smokers Anonymous is to bring people of any background, whether it be religious, ethnic, race or any 
        other differences in human definition and work out why these persons have trouble quitting or staying away from smoking
        specifically cigarettes. Many people find that smoking is addictive but many people that do smoke do not have people to talk
        to about why it is that they smoke or how to recover from it. Now, while it may not be like drinking or other drug abuse
        substances, as it doesn't impair judgement, it has been found in many different studies to have the same addictive properties as 
        that of cocaine which means that it needs to be treated with the same level of care as any other drugs should be and are while
        sadly smoking cigarettes has not been. 
      </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Now then, as some of the details of smoking and the idea behind why smoking needs to be treated with care have been given in the 
        purpose behind this site it is now imperative to speak about why it can effect your day to day life. You will often find yourself
        pausing a show to smoke, which as a single person may not be that detrimental, but as a member of a family can cause social drifting
        between you and your spouse and/or children. Without a cigarette you will start to feel angry much more easily finding interation to
        be incredibly difficult while also causing anxiety and depression as well. So I want to start by asking this, do you smoke because 
        it is a good way to avoid these feelings? Many people try to smoke to avoid the one thing that will be just as hard if not harder to 
        deal with once quitting. It doesn't really give any real solution but a temperary one, and also decreases your desire to eat sometimes 
        eating only once a day and drinking water causing immense dehydration. I want to ask you all today to come together on this site and even 
        in person to talk about why it is that you smoke, what made you start and what you feel could help you to quit as well as how to combat
        the reasons you do smoke and find much more healthy ways to deal with these reasons for doing so in the first place.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea behind making this site is to get people to quit smoking and while in theory it might sound easy for people, not always is that the case. We focus on these individuals by giving them a combination of allowing them to talk about their days in a therapeutic manner as well as giving themselves a sense of introspection as well as opening themselves up to only constructive criticism that is meant to build eachother up in emotional and physical manners. This will then allow us and even themselves to understand why it was that they started smoking cigarettes in the first place, and from there see if talking out that issue and giving possible solutions will help benefit them in the long run and if it will help them find a better way to stay away from said cigarettes.

      <h3>Dangers of Smoking</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main dangers of smoking is cancer and it isn't just lung cancer either it is a lot more than that. Smoking causes cancer of the lungs, the mouth and or throat, voice box, esophagus, stomach, kidney, pancreas, liver, bladder, cervix, colon and or rectom as well as acute myeloid leukemia. I will name them off as they have been listed to you previously, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Laryngeal Cancer, Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and stomach, Renal Cell Carcinoma also called RCC, Ducral Carcinoma or also called Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Urothelial Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the cervix, Colorectal Cancer of the colon and rectom. Note that if you are diagnosed with any of these you are free to chat here but you should first go and seek out medical attention immediately. These cancers can make it hard to breathe blood in stools abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness or fatigue as well as diarrhea often or constipation but a general change in stool regularity, lumps or sweeling of the neck, long lasting breathlessness, high pitched wheezing, pain when swallowing, blood in urine, painful urination or back pain, loss of appetite yellowing of the skin, itchy skin, blood clots, diabetes, heartburn, feeling sick, feeling bloated after eating, pain in your stomach of breastbone, frequent burping, feeling full very quickly when eating. chest pain, coughing up blood, feeling tired all the time and more. If you are having any of these symptoms you should also go and seek medical attention immediately. But that is not all it causes as it changes the brain on a chemical level which can cause you to overthink, anxiety, depression, fits of rage over small things or irritability, disconnection, self distancing and even thoughts of suicide. If you are feeling any of these that is why this site was created and we are here for you. You can talk to us online in the Chat with Others Online Page where you can join at the bottom of the page. Some things to think about when you have anxiety is the urge to want to leave where you are and that could be at home around your children or wanting to leave wherever they take you. Disconnect can keep you from forming relationships with your children, impair your relations with your spouse, partner or friends, depression can lead to suicide and is very vital that you talk to someone when feeling depressed of sad for long periods of time that you cant seem to shake. Being irritable can cause you to lash out at friends and family and even sometimes yourself because of anything, it is not bound to any one thing.

      <h3>Chat with Others Online</h3>
      <p>
        There is a few rules that we have in mind when chatting online with other people that suffer from the same thing that you do. First we will start by going over the way chatting online in our site works. We have developed a way to chat specifically inside the site so you never have to go outside of the site and you don't have to enter any personal information that you are not comfortable with. You are not able to chat with people privately as everything will be out in the open where you will all be set in groups of 20 almost like being in the building and talking to one another. Just like being in the building you will have 1 person that guides the group and you can talk with these persons at any given time only inside of the site. You are not to give or ask for any personal information from them to keep a professional work environment. In doing so you can be barred from the site as well as getting the guide of the group fired in the process so it is important that you not do such things. They are also paid quite well to help you, it is also very easy to apply if you ever desire to help others. But in general we like people that apply to have clinical therapy schooling with a bachelors or greater in general psychology as well as being able to help with some technical difficulties. As such you will also need to have developer experience with at least a certificate from any college with a GPA of at least 3.0. You will be able to apply down at the bottom of the page. Other pieces of knowledge that need to be known are the expected times you are to be available and depending on your availability will depend on what group that you will be assigned to. There will be multiples of each time though as we don't want to exceed the ceiling limit of 20 per group as that is the max. You are also free to talk on other times as well but you will have a designation to at least one time. Also you are not able to send any images, this is a chat only specific area. Without further explanation we will go into the rules specifically. * No racism * No Explicit language * No sexually inappropriate messaging * No Harrassing others * No talking on political views. Remember this is both a professional work space as well as a chatting space with no judgement of others. Depending on what is done can either get you suspended or banned as well as barred from the site so please do be careful on what it is that you decide to say. You are only obligated to give your name and create avatar for the site, happy chatting.
