                <h1 id="paragraph1title">Chat Online</h1>
                <p id="paragraph">There is a few rules that we have in mind when chatting online with other people that suffer from the same thing that you do. First we will start by going over the way chatting online in our site works. We have developed a way to chat specifically inside the site so you never have to go outside of the site and you don't have to enter any personal information that you are not comfortable with. You are not able to chat with people privately as everything will be out in the open where you will all be set in groups of 20 almost like being in the building and talking to one another. Just like being in the building you will have 1 person that guides the group and you can talk with these persons at any given time only inside of the site. You are not to give or ask for any personal information from them to keep a professional work environment. In doing so you can be barred from the site as well as getting the guide of the group fired in the process so it is important that you not do such things. They are also paid quite well to help you, it is also very easy to apply if you ever desire to help others.<img id="list" src="images/list.jpg" alt="check list"> But in general we like people that apply to have clinical therapy schooling with a bachelors or greater in general psychology as well as being able to help with some technical difficulties. As such you will also need to have developer experience with at least a certificate from any college with a GPA of at least 3.0. You will be able to apply down at the bottom of the page. Other pieces of knowledge that need to be known are the expected times you are to be available and depending on your availability will depend on what group that you will be assigned to. There will be multiples of each time though as we don't want to exceed the ceiling limit of 20 per group as that is the max. You are also free to talk on other times as well but you will have a designation to at least one time. Also you are not able to send any images, this is a chat only specific area. Without further explanation we will go into the rules specifically. <img id="degree" src="images/degree.jpg" alt="grad cap"> <ul id="rules"> <li>No racism</li> <li>No Explicit language</li> <li>No sexually inappropriate messaging</li> <li>No Harrassing others</li> <li>No talking on political views</li></ul><p>Remember this is both a professional work space as well as a chatting space with no judgement of others. Depending on what is done can either get you suspended or banned as well as barred from the site so please do be careful on what it is that you decide to say. You are only obligated to give your name and create avatar for the site, happy chatting.</p>
